    <h1 style="color: green;"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span></h1>
    <p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> (Database Utility Map-Producing Read-Only Web Service) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</a> program that allows a geospatial database to be queried using a web browser.  It is a native application (written in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/">C</a>), and its only dependency is the C standard library.  It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free, open-source software (FOSS)</a>, distributed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.  (In a nutshell, you can do whatever you want with it, so long as it retains the copyright notice.)</p>
    <p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> leverages the abilities of database utilities to produce HTML output by serving as a wrapper that chooses command line options, processes input, and augments output as needed to respond to HTTP requests.  Use cases may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>seeing the results of a spatial query on a map</li>
      <li>saving URLs as bookmarks/favorites in your browser (convenient for viewing the results of frequently run queries)</li>
      <li>sending URLs via email (very useful for sharing queries/resultsets with colleagues)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> also provides the ability to generate queries using <i>query templates</i> (parameterized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)"><code>SELECT</code></a> statements), which are handy for queries that are essentially the same but have minor differences (e.g., they might query different tables).</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> is similar to other applications commonly used with CGI (e.g., <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perl">perl</a>) in that it is hosted by a web server, where it functions as the interpreter of a "script" file, which in this case consists of exactly four lines:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>an interpreter directive (i.e., a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang</a>" line)</li>
      <li>one of the following indicators of which database engine/utility to use:
        <ul>
          <li>Oracle</li>
          <li>PostgreSQL</li>
          <li>SQLite</li>
          <li>SpatiaLite</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>connection information (depends on database engine/utility)</li>
      <li>a relative path to a query template file, or empty</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When the web server receives a request for a CGI script, its filename is passed as an argument to the interpreter (in this case, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> executable).  The query string of the URL determines what is output.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the query string is empty, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> outputs a web page that prompts for a query, which can be generated using a query template (and then edited if/as desired) or entered directly into the <b>Query</b> text area.  (The web page includes a few built-in templates, and several more are available in the <a href="https://github.com/jeffbourdier/dumprows">GitHub repository</a>.  To see the web page that prompts for a query, <a href="prompt.html">click here</a>.)</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the query string should contain a single parameter, <code>q</code>, whose value is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)">SQL <code>SELECT</code></a> statement.  The query is <a href="https://bobby-tables.com/">validated</a><sup>1</sup>, and the appropriate database utility is executed with the query as input.  If the resulting table has a geometry column with spatial data<sup>2</sup> in <a href="https://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> format, a <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map (with base data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>) showing the geospatial features is added to the HTML output.</li>
    </ul>
    <small>
      <sup>1</sup> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> implements a crude form of validation that simply checks to make sure the query appears to be a <code>SELECT</code> statement (and not an <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> statement), thus preventing any data modification.  It does not check for valid SQL syntax; the database utility will do that.<br />
      <sup>2</sup> Coordinates are assumed to be geographic (longitude, latitude), using the <a href="https://earth-info.nga.mil/index.php?dir=wgs84&action=wgs84">WGS 84</a> spheroid.<br />
    </small>
    <p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> can also be run via command line (e.g., for testing purposes) by setting the <code>QUERY_STRING</code> environment variable as follows.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On Windows:<pre>CMD /C "SET QUERY_STRING=<i>string</i>& dumprows <i>file</i>"</pre></li>
      <li>On Linux:<pre>QUERY_STRING=<i>string</i> sh -c "dumprows <i>file</i>"</pre></li>
    </ul>
    <p>where <code><i>string</i></code> is the query string, and <code><i>file</i></code> is the pathname of the CGI script.  (Note that on Windows, <code><i>string</i></code> cannot be empty.)</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The examples below demonstrate different CGI scripts when using <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> with various operating systems, databases, and geometry types.  It is assumed that <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> is hosted on a machine called <code>GISA</code>.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Oracle (on Windows)</h3>
        <p>This example applies to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/spatialandgraph/overview/index.html">Oracle Spatial</a> (version 12.2 or later, with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/spatl/SDO_UTIL-reference.html#GUID-DB459897-729F-41D6-A2F3-DD39F22D8F63">SDO_UTIL.TO_GEOJSON</a>).  Consider the following script file, called <code>NY_mapper.dumprows</code>:</p>
        <pre>
#!C:\Program Files (x86)\dumprows.exe
Oracle
MAPPER/maps_20@GISNY
oracle.json</pre>
        <p>If the server were to receive the following request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would output the web page that prompts for a query, with query templates loaded from the file <code>oracle.json</code>:</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/NY_mapper.dumprows</pre>
        <p>Let's say the following query returns a set of point features representing school buildings in Brockport, New York:</p>
        <pre>
SELECT DESCRIPTION AS "Description", ADDRESS AS "Address", SDO_UTIL.TO_GEOJSON(GEOM) AS "Location"
FROM BROCKPORT.SCHOOL
ORDER BY ADDRESS;</pre>
        <p>This query would equate to the following URL:</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/NY_mapper.dumprows?q=SELECT+DESCRIPTION+AS+"Description"%2C+ADDRESS+AS+"Address"%2C+SDO_UTIL.TO_GEOJSON%28GEOM%29+AS+"Location"%0D%0AFROM+BROCKPORT.SCHOOL%0D%0AORDER+BY+ADDRESS</pre>
        <p>(This URL would be generated by the web page that prompts for a query.)  If the server were to receive this request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would execute <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqpug/index.html">SQL*Plus&reg;</a>, connecting to a database called <code>GISNY</code> as user <code>MAPPER</code> with a password of <code>maps_20</code> (with the query as input).  <a href="results1.html">Click here</a> to see the results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>PostgreSQL (on Windows)</h3>
        <p>This example applies to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> with the <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> extension.  Consider the following script file, called <code>fpm.dumprows</code>:</p>
        <pre>
#!C:\Program Files (x86)\dumprows.exe
PostgreSQL
"host=GISDB1 dbname=footprint user=mobile password=abc123"
postgresql.json</pre>
        <p>If the server were to receive the following request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would output the web page that prompts for a query, with query templates loaded from the file <code>postgresql.json</code>:</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/fpm.dumprows</pre>
        <p>Let's say the following query returns a set of polygon features representing the coterminous United States:</p>
        <pre>
SELECT fips_code AS "FIPS", usps_code AS "USPS", name AS "Name", ST_AsGeoJSON(shape) AS "Location"
FROM states
WHERE (fips_code::integer &lt; 60) AND (usps_code NOT IN ('AK', 'HI'))
ORDER BY fips_code;</pre>
        <p>This query would equate to the following URL:</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/fpm.dumprows?q=SELECT+fips_code+AS+"FIPS"%2C+usps_code+AS+"USPS"%2C+name+AS+"Name"%2C+ST_AsGeoJSON%28shape%29+AS+"Location"%0D%0AFROM+states%0D%0AWHERE+%28fips_code%3A%3Ainteger+&lt;+60%29+AND+%28usps_code+NOT+IN+%28%27AK%27%2C+%27HI%27%29%29%0D%0AORDER+BY+fips_code</pre>
        <p>(This URL would be generated by the web page that prompts for a query.)  If the server were to receive this request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would execute <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">psql</a>, connecting to a database called <code>footprint</code> (hosted on a machine called <code>GISDB1</code>) as user <code>mobile</code> with a password of <code>abc123</code> (with the query as input).  <a href="results2.html">Click here</a> to see the results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>PostgreSQL (on Linux)</h3>
        <p>(This example does not require <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>.)  Consider the following script file, called <code>sysadmin.dumprows</code>:</p>
        <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/dumprows
PostgreSQL
postgresql://admin:vgm2u@DBPG2:10987/sysapps?ssl=true
</pre>
        <p>If the server were to receive the following request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would output the web page that prompts for a query (without loading any extra query templates):</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/sysadmin.dumprows</pre>
        <p>Let's say the following query returns a resultset indicating how many users of an application live in each state:</p>
        <pre>
SELECT states.name AS "State", count(*) AS "Count"
FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN states ON (users.state_usps = states.usps_code)
GROUP BY states.name
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1;</pre>
        <p>This query would equate to the following URL:</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/sysadmin.dumprows?q=SELECT+states.name+AS+"State"%2C+count%28*%29+AS+"Count"%0D%0AFROM+users+LEFT+OUTER+JOIN+states+ON+%28users.state_usps+%3D+states.usps_code%29%0D%0AGROUP+BY+states.name%0D%0AORDER+BY+2+DESC%2C+1</pre>
        <p>(This URL would be generated by the web page that prompts for a query.)  If the server were to receive this request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would execute <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">psql</a>, connecting to a database called <code>sysapps</code> (hosted on a machine called <code>DBPG2</code>, via port <code>10987</code>, requiring an SSL connection) as user <code>admin</code> with a password of <code>vgm2u</code> (with the query as input).  <a href="results3.html">Click here</a> to see the results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>SpatiaLite (on Linux)</h3>
        <p>This example applies to <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a> (version 5 or later, with the GPKG (GeoPackage) extension module).  Consider the following script file, called <code>pml.dumprows</code>:</p>
        <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/dumprows
SpatiaLite
/home/jeff/Downloads/PML-1.0-Official-Sample-Files/PML_Valid_Large01.gpkg
sqlite.json</pre>
        <p>If the server were to receive the following request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would output the web page that prompts for a query, with query templates loaded from the file <code>sqlite.json</code>:</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/pml.dumprows</pre>
        <p>Let's say the following query returns a set of linestring features from a <a href="https://www.geopackage.org/">GeoPackage</a> produced by the <a href="https://pipelineml.org/how-to-install-and-use-the-pipelineml-geopackager/">PipelineML GeoPackager</a>:</p>
        <pre>
SELECT 'Linepipe' AS "Component", CAST(code AS INTEGER) AS "Code", AsGeoJSON(GeomFromGPB(geom)) AS "Location" FROM Linepipe WHERE (CAST(code AS INTEGER) &gt; 1712042) UNION ALL
SELECT 'Valve'    AS "Component", CAST(code AS INTEGER) AS "Code", AsGeoJSON(GeomFromGPB(geom)) AS "Location" FROM Valve    WHERE (CAST(code AS INTEGER) &gt;    9276) UNION ALL
SELECT 'Tee'      AS "Component", CAST(code AS INTEGER) AS "Code", AsGeoJSON(GeomFromGPB(geom)) AS "Location" FROM Tee
ORDER BY 2;</pre>
        <p>This query would equate to the following URL:</p>

        <p>(This URL would be generated by the web page that prompts for a query.)  If the server were to receive this request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would execute <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite-tools/index">spatialite</a>, connecting to a database called <code>PML_Valid_Large01.gpkg</code> (with the query as input).  <a href="results4.html">Click here</a> to see the results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>SQLite (on Linux)</h3>
        <p>This example is similar to the previous, but applies to plain <a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> (without geospatial functionality).  The script file could be identical, except for the database utility (line 2):</p>
        <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/dumprows
SQLite
/home/jeff/Downloads/PML-1.0-Official-Sample-Files/PML_Valid_Large01.gpkg
sqlite.json</pre>
        <p>The query could be similar as well, returning instead the total number of features in each table:</p>
        <pre>
SELECT 'Linepipe' AS "Component", COUNT(*) AS "Count" FROM Linepipe UNION ALL
SELECT 'Valve'    AS "Component", COUNT(*) AS "Count" FROM Valve    UNION ALL
SELECT 'Tee'      AS "Component", COUNT(*) AS "Count" FROM Tee
ORDER BY 2 DESC;</pre>
        <p>This query would equate to the following URL:</p>
        <pre>http://GISA/cgi-bin/pml.dumprows?q=SELECT+%27Linepipe%27+AS+"Component"%2C+COUNT%28*%29+AS+"Count"+FROM+Linepipe+UNION+ALL%0D%0ASELECT+%27Valve%27+AS+"Component"%2C+COUNT%28*%29+AS+"Count"+FROM+Valve+UNION+ALL%0D%0ASELECT+%27Tee%27+AS+"Component"%2C+COUNT%28*%29+AS+"Count"+FROM+Tee%0D%0AORDER+BY+2+DESC</pre>
        <p>If the server were to receive this request, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">DumpRows</span> would execute <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html">sqlite3</a>, again connecting to the database <code>PML_Valid_Large01.gpkg</code> (with the query as input).  <a href="results5.html">Click here</a> to see the results.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
